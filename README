Preamble
========

I wrote mopher between 2009 and 2010 as a replacement for milter-greylist. It
ran quite stable over a year without any code changes. Because I never found
the time to write usable documentation I didn't release it publicly. Most of
the documentation is still missing. Feel free to contribute.


Design goals:

  * Lightweight and modular design
  * Firewall like configuration
  * Fully support libmilter features (early 2010)
  * Flexible greylisting (time, retry count)
  * Filter spam efficiently


Features:

  * Greylisting
  * Tarpitting
  * Spamassassin
  * RBL
  * SQLite
  * MySQL


Installation
============

  make
  make install

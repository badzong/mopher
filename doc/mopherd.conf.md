# NAME
mopherd.conf - mopherd configuration file syntax

# SYNOPSIS
**{{ MOPHERD_CONF }}**

# DESCRIPTION
**mopherd.conf** controls the behavior of the mopherd mail filter daemon.
Mopherd has a simple and solid builtin configuration and should run out of the
box without any configuration changes necessary. However some mopher features
need a little configuration.

## Main Configuration Directives

  * acl_log_level ([0-7], default: 3):
    Syslog log level for messages logged through mail.acl log directive. 0 is
    the highest, 7 the lowest log level, where lower means more messages.
    
  * acl_path (default: {{ MAIL_ACL }}):
    Path where mopherd looks for the mail access control list. The mail.acl
    controls how mopher handles incoming email.

  * client_retry_interval
    ( EXPERIMENTAL )

  * control_socket (default: inet:127.0.0.1:44554)
    The control socket is used by moco to control a running mopherd instance.
    Supported socket types are inet sockets (TCP/SOCK_STREAM) and unix domain
    sockets.

  * dbt_cleanup_interval (seconds, default: 600):
    Most mopher tables need regular clean up. Depending on the used database
    backend this may require a full table lock and block all email delivery
    until the table is clean. Do not bother to change this setting unless your
    server handels hundreds of connections per second.

  * foreground ([0|1], default: 0)
    If set to 1 mopherd does not fork into background. Mostly useful for
    debugging.

  * greylist_deadline (seconds, default: 86400)
    Default greylist deadline if not given in mail.acl. If deadline has passed
    the greylist record is deleted from the greylist table.

  * greylist_visa (seconds, default: 2592000)
    Default greylist visa time if not given in mail.acl. If a relay passes
    greylisting once it will no longer be greylisted. Every time a relay sends
    an email, the visa is renewd.

  * hostname (default: gethostname(3))
    Hostname used in self references. E.g. for the fake spamd received header.

  * milter_socket (default: inet:44555@127.0.0.1)
    The milter socket is used by your MTA e.g. Postfix or Sendmail to connect
    to mopherd. Supported socket types are inet sockets (TCP/SOCK_STREAM) and
    unix domain sockets.

    CAVEAT: New inet socket format: inet:port@bindaddr (e.g. inet:1234@0.0.0.0)

  * milter_socket_timeout (seconds, default: -1)
    The number of seconds for libmilter to wait before timing out.

  * milter_socket_permissions (octal permissions, default: 666)
    UNIX filesystem permissions for the milter socket. Only applies to unix
    domain sockets.

  * milter_wait FIXME
    Number of seconds mopherd waits for all milter threads to close upon exit.

  * mopherd_group (default: mopherd)
    If mopherd is running with group root it switches to this group for
    security reasons. Files and sockets are created with this group.

  * mopherd_user (default: mopherd)
    If mopherd is running as user root it switches to this user for
    security reasons. Files and sockets are created as this user.

  * module_path (default: {{ MODULE_PATH}})
    Directory where mopherd looks for modules. All modules in this directory
    are automatically loaded on startup.

  * tarpit_progress_interval (seconds, default: 10)
    Number of seconds tarpit repeatedly logs a debug message while tarpitting.

  * workdir_path (default: /)
    Mopherd changes the current working directory to workdir_path on startup.


## Database configuration

Mopher uses database tables to store information. At this moment mopher has
these four tables:

  * state
    The state table saves the mopherd state. Currently the only value stored
    in this database is the milter_id. This is handy for unique email
    identification in logs.

  * greylist
    The greylist database.

  * counter_relay
    The counter module counts every delivered email for every relay. 
    
  * counter_penpal
    The counter module counts every delivered email for every sender and
    recipient address combination.


### Supported databases

  * memdb
    A hashtable stored only in memory. All contents are lost when mopher exits.

  * bdb (Berkeley DB)
    High performance embedded database system. 

  * sakila (MySQL)
    Widely used SQL database management system. The name sakila was chosen, to
    maintain a clean namespace.


### Database examples

table[state] = {
    "driver" = "bdb",
    "path"   = "/var/local/lib/mopher/state.bdb"
}
    
table[greylist] = {
    "driver"   = "sakila",
    "host"     = "192.168.1.100",
    "database" = "mopher",
    "table"    = "mopher_greylist",
    "user"     = "mopherd",
    "pass"     = "secret"
}
    

## Modules

### Counter

The counter module counts accepted and delivered mails and keeps track of
relays and penpals. The module can provide a shortcut through your mail.acl
for regularly seen mail relays or sender recipient address pairs.

  * counter_expire_low
    Number of seconds counter records are kept in the database with counter
    value lower than counter_threshoold.

  * counter_expire_high
    Number of seconds counter records are kept in the database with counter
    value higher than counter_threshoold.

  * counter_threshold
    Number of successful delivered emails to switch from low to high.


### Realtime Blacklists (RBL)

To use RBLs in your mail.acl, you need to configure them in your mopherd.conf.
All RBL symbols are configured in the *rbl* configuration table. For example if
you want to use your own RBL named rbl_example from blacklist.example.org.

rbl[rbl_example] = "blacklist.example.org"


### Spamassassin

To connect spamassassins spamd you need to set spamd_socket. The default is set
to localhost port 783.

spamd_socket (default: inet:127.0.0.1:783):

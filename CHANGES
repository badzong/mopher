Recent changes to mopher's source.

Version 0.5.1
10.11.2014
    Fix multiple problems around loading and punycode translation of
        UTF-8 regdom rules on NetBSD systems.

Version 0.5.0
06.11.2014
    This release contains many new features, almost 18 months of
        successful testing in production environments and a variety of
        adjustments and bugfixes.
    Serious attempt at complete documentation, multiple man pages added:
        mopher.7 mopherctl.8 mopherd.8 mopherd.acl.5 mopherd.conf.5
    The bdb backend switched to legacy BDB format (1.85), libdb is no
        longer a dependency on BSD systems with dbopen(3) in libc.
    Mozilla's Public Suffix rule list is no longer compiled into mopher
        but a regular file that may be updated and reloaded.
    The experimental database logging module (dblog) was added.  Its
        purpose is a fast history of structured session data, easy to
        query and translate into statistics or periodic reports.
    Introduction of basic unit test infrastructure.
    moco was renamed to mopherctl, see mopherctl(8).
    mail.acl was renamed to mopherd.acl, see mopherd.acl(5).
    Pattern and list operators were added, see mopherd.acl(5).
    Macro symbols in mopherd.acl(5) now use the same naming scheme like
        their Sendmail counterparts, including the curly braces.

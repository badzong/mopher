.Sh NAME
.Nm mopher
.Nd versatile mail filter
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The mail gopher (mopher) is an extension to all mail transfer agents
(MTAs) that implement the Sendmail Milter API.
It reads a list of rules and acts on each incoming mail delivery attempt
based on various criteria and existing states.
Since the general idea behind mopher is to replace the chain of milters
that is often consulted by the MTA, mopher's design is modular and its
language can be extended through a variety of loadable mopher
modules.
.Pp
The following list describes mopher's core features:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy Greylisting
Mopher supports indiscriminate and selective greylisting.
It lists either individual addresses or whole domains (based on reverse
lookups and rules provided by Mozilla's Public Suffix List) and keeps
track of all retries by a particular origin.
Listing domains avoids cases where several load balancing MTAs are
trying to deliver the same message, while counting retries
.Pq and acting upon the result
can speed up the inevitable.
.It Sy Whitelisting
Mopher supports whitelisting origins (address or domain) based on their
amount of successfully delivered messages.
It also tracks penpals, which are triplets containing the origin, the
sender- and the recipient-address.
Whitelisting based on penpals is the prefered strategy when dealing with
Email providers that host large numbers of legitimate users but also
significant amounts of spammers.
.It Sy Tarpitting
Mopher supports delaying incoming mail delivery attempts.
Tarpitting, like any other action, can be applied selectively.
.It Sy Generic Storage
All tables kept by mopher are accessed through a generic interface.
The selection of backends is therefore only limited by the amount of
available database modules.
Currently, several backend modules are provided.
.It Sy Custom Logging
Mopher uses a well structured default log format and allows for
additional custom logging at any stage, which also includes the access
to all symbols available at that particular stage.
.It Sy Custom Headers
The injection of custom headers is possible.
Like with custom logging, all symbols available at a particular stage
are also available when defining a custom header and its content.
.It Sy Control Socket
Communication with a running mopher daemon is possible through its
control socket.
Available actions are currently limited to the printing of tables and
modifying of greylist items.

Successfully configuring and running mopher requires a basic
understanding of SMTP and its various stages.
Users are also encouraged to consult

in order to get an overview of the basic language and its expressions.

.Em Note :
Third party distributors of binary packages may split a full mopher
build into several complementary packages in order to make some
dependencies optional.
In such cases, it is possible that some modules are not available on
your system even though they are listed here.

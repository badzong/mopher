.Sh NAME
.Nm mopherd.acl
.Nd the mopher daemon access control list
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains a list of rules enforced by
.Xr mopherd 8
at one or more milter stages.
.Pp
Comment lines in
.Nm
start with the
.Ql #
character, empty lines are treated as comments.
Statements are either definitions or rules and can span multiple lines.
.Sh RULES
A statement is a rule if it has the following structure:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sy stage condition action
.Ed
.Pp
A
.Em stage
is generally named after a milter stage and it is therefore necessary to
know how the available milter stages correspond to the various stages of
a SMTP transaction:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy milter stage" ".Sy SMTP stage"
.It Sy milter stage Ta Sy SMTP stage
.It connect Ta (connection established)
.It helo Ta HELO (hostname)
.It envfrom Ta MAIL FROM: (sender)
.It envrcpt Ta RCPT TO: (one recipient)
.It data Ta DATA
.It header Ta (one header)
.It eoh Ta (empty line)
.It body Ta (one line of body)
.It eom Ta .
.It close Ta QUIT
.El
.Pp
The milter stages
.Em envrcpt ,
.Em header
and
.Em body
can be entered one or more times during a SMTP transaction.
If the remote host or the MTA closes the connection prematurely while
being in any stage between
.Em envfrom
and
.Em eom ,
the additional stage
.Em abort
will be entered before entering
.Em close .
If the remote host issues unknown commands during a SMTP transaction,
the additional stage
.Em unknown
will be entered.
.Pp
After entering a milter stage,
.Em condition
is evaluated.
If the evaluation returns true,
.Em action
is taken.
A condition is an
.Em expression .
.Sh EXPRESSIONS
An expression is recursively defined as one or more expressions,
associated by 
.Em arithmetic ,
.Em relational ,
.Em pattern ,
.Em list
and
.Em boolean operators .
Basic expressions are
.Em constants ,
.Em variables ,
.Em symbols ,
.Em functions
and
.Em lists .
.Pp
A
.Em constant
is either a string, integer, float or address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
"foo"		# string
"1"		# string
""		# string
100		# integer
1.1		# float
::1		# address
127.0.0.1	# address
.Ed
.Pp
Each integer may have one of the following optional suffixes:
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset indent -compact
.It s[econd]
multiply by 1
.It m[inute]
multiply by 60
.It h[our]
multiply by 3600
.It d[ay]
multiply by 86400
.It K[ibi]
multiply by 1024
.It M[ebi]
multiply by 1048576
.It G[ibi]
multiply by 1073741824
.El
.Pp
A
.Em variable
begins with a
.Ql $
and is a resolvable entity that may be set at any milter stage
.Pq see Sx ACTIONS Ns : Em set No action .
.Pp
A
.Em symbol
is a resolvable entity that may or may not be available at a particular
milter stage
.Pq see Sx SYMBOLS .
.Pp
A
.Em function
is a resolvable entity that is always available and has zero or more
parameters
.Pq see Sx FUNCTIONS .
.Pp
A
.Em list
is a searchable entity with zero or more items
.Pq see Sx LISTS .
.Pp
Variables, symbols and functions will only be resolved if they appear in
an expression that is being evaluated.
Resolving variables, symbols and functions may yield unknown values
alias
.Em null
values.
Unknown values have a certain effect on the way boolean operators work.
If one or more operands in an arithmetic or relational operation is
null, the result will be unknown and therefore null.
.Pp
.Em Arithmetic operations
.Po
.Ql + ,
.Ql - ,
.Ql * ,
.Ql / ,
.Ql %
.Pc
on integers and floats work as one might expect.
Implicit type conversion will take place if necessary and possible.
Division
.Pq Ql /
of integers may yield truncated results, addition
.Pq Ql +
of strings will concatenate them and modulo reduction
.Pq Ql %
is only defined on integers:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
"foo" + "bar"	# "foobar"
3 / 2		# 1
3 / 2.0		# 1.5
3 % 2		# 1
3 % 2.0		# error
.Ed
.Pp
.Em Relational operations
.Po
.Ql <  ,
.Ql <= ,
.Ql >  ,
.Ql >= ,
.Ql == ,
.Ql !=
.Pc
on integers, floats and strings work as one might expect.
Implicit type conversion will take place if necessary and possible.
.Pp
.Em Pattern operators
.Po
.Ql ~ ,
.Ql !~
.Pc
associate two string operands and interpret the operand on the
right-hand side as a sequence pattern described using POSIX Extended
Regular Expressions.
The pattern is case-sensitive if it contains at least one upper case
letter, case-insensitive otherwise.
.Pp
.Ql ~
evaluates true if the string operand on the left-hand side
matches the pattern, false othervise.
.Ql !~
operates the same way, but inverts the evaluation result.
.Pp
.Em List operators
.Po
.Ql in
.Pc
are only defined on lists
.Pq see Sx LISTS .
.Pp
.Em Boolean operators
.Po
.Ql \&! ,
.Ql && ,
.Ql ||
.Pc
mimic their counterparts within the Kleene logic which is a three-valued
logic.
Truth values of a 3VL consist of
.Em true ,
.Em false
and a third, indeterminate value
.Em unknown
or
.Em null .
.Pp
The truth table for
.Ql \&!
.Pq NOT
and any expression
.Em A :
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy abcde" ".Sy abcde"
.It Sy A Ta Sy !A
.It false Ta true
.It null  Ta null
.It true  Ta false
.El
.Pp
The truth table for
.Ql &&
.Pq AND ,
.Ql ||
.Pq OR
and any expression
.Em A
and
.Em B :
.Bl -column -offset indent ".Sy abcde" ".Sy abcde" ".Sy abcde" ".Sy abcde"
.It Sy A Ta Sy B Ta Sy A && B Ta Sy A || B
.It false Ta false Ta false Ta false
.It false Ta null  Ta false Ta null
.It false Ta true  Ta false Ta true
.It null  Ta false Ta false Ta null

.It null  Ta true  Ta null  Ta true
.It true  Ta false Ta false Ta true
.It true  Ta null  Ta null  Ta true
.It true  Ta true  Ta true  Ta true
.El
.Pp
Evaluating an
.Em integer
or a
.Em float
will yield false if the particular value is 0, true otherwise.
.Pp
Evaluating a
.Em string
will yield false if its value is
.Qq
.Pq empty
or
.Qq 0 ,
true otherwise.
.Pp
Evaluating an
.Em address
will yield false if the address is invalid, true otherwise.
.Pp
Evaluating a
.Em list
will yield false if the list is empty, true otherwise.
.Pp
.Em Note :
During the evaluation of any rule, action will only be taken if
condition is true.
false and null are equivalent in that case.
.Sh ACTIONS
An action describes how
.Xr mopherd 8
and therefore the MTA, should handle the current SMTP transaction.
Actions may have parameters that may or may not be omitted.
.Pp
If the examples in the following list do not explicitly mention the
stage and condition part of a rule, they are implied but omitted for
reasons of brevity.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy continue
The continue action will stop the evaluation of any remaining rules tied
to the current milter stage.
Evaluation will continue at the next milter stage.
.It Sy reject
The reject action will reject the current SMTP transaction with a
permanent error code and stop any further processing.
.It Sy discard
The discard action will accept the current SMTP transaction, discard the
message silently and stop any further processing.
.It Sy accept
The accept action will accept the current SMTP transaction and stop any
further processing.
.It Sy tempfail
The tempfail action will reject the current SMTP transaction with a
temporary error code and stop any further processing.
.It Sy greylist \
Bo Sy delay Em exp Bc \
Bo Sy attempts Em exp Bc \
Bo Sy deadline Em exp Bc \
Bo Sy visa Em exp Bc
Until one of two possible thresholds are met, the greylist action will
reject the current SMTP transaction with a temporary error code and stop
any further processing.
.Pp
Greylisting an origin
.Pq address or domain
means keeping track of the effort made by that origin to deliver a
message by a specific sender to a specific recipient.
Effort is defined as either the number of
.Em attempts
made by the origin or the
.Em delay
he was willing to accept in order to carry out a particular SMTP
transaction:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# reject until 12 hours have passed
#
greylist delay 12h

# reject until 2 attempts are recorded
#
greylist attempts 2

# reject until 2 attempts are recorded within 4 hours
#
greylist attempts 2 deadline 4h

# reject until 12 hours have passed
#   or 5 attempts are recorded within 4 hours
#
greylist delay 12h attempts 5 deadline 4h
.Ed
.Pp
After the required effort has been made,
.Xr mopherd 8
will upgrade the greylist triplet
.Pq origin, sender and recipient combination
to a
.Em visa
triplet.
A visa triplet will allow for undelayed SMTP transactions until it
expires:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# reject until 12 hours have passed
#   or 5 attempts are recorded within 4 hours
#   and issue a visa for 7 days on success
#
greylist delay 12h attempts 5 deadline 4h visa 7d
.Ed
.Pp
Successful SMTP transactions that resemble a valid visa triplet will
automatically trigger the renewal of the corresponding visa.
.Pp
.Em Note :
Right before any greylist rules, your
.Nm
should contain one empty greylist rule:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# empty greylist rule
#
<stage> greylist
.Ed
.Pp
An empty greylist rule will compare all existing greylist triplets with
the current SMTP transaction and, in case a triplet matches, avoid the
evaluation of subsequent greylist rules that are tied to potentially
costly conditions.
.It Sy tarpit Em exp
The tarpit action will delay the current SMTP transaction (without
rejecting it):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# delay for 60 seconds
#
tarpit 60s
.Ed
.It Sy log Em exp
The log action will log any custom message:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# log "New connection from some.host.name!"
#
log "New connection from " + hostname + "!"
.Ed
.It Sy set $ Ns Em id No = Em exp
The set action will set a variable:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# set $flag to 1
#
set $flag = 1
.Ed
.It Sy jump Em exp
The jump action will stop the evaluation of any remaining rules tied to
the current stage and jump to a different stage:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# jump to first rule of stage2 if <condition> is true
#
stage1 <condition> jump stage2
stage1 ...	# not evaluated if <condition> is true
stage1 ...	# not evaluated if <condition> is true

stage2 ...
stage2 ...
stage2 ...
.Ed
.Pp
From the perspective of
.Xr mopherd 8 ,
there are no special stages.
Every stage is just a named list of rules, but only stages that are
named after one of the known milter stages will be entered during SMTP
transactions.
Therefore, jumping stages is a way of conditionally extending milter
stages.
.Pp
.Em Warning :
Beware of circular jumps.
.\".It Sy pipe Em exp
.\"FIXME: EXPERIMENTAL
.It Sy add header Em exp Sy value Em exp
The add header action will add
.Em header
if it doesn't exist and replace
its
.Em value
otherwise.
.It Sy insert header Em exp Sy value Em exp Bo Sy index Em exp Bc
The insert header action will always add
.Em header .
If
.Em index
is greater than the number of existing headers,
.Em header
will be added at the end of the list.
If
.Em index
is 0
.Pq default ,
.Em header
will be added at the beginning of the list.
.It Sy change header Em exp Sy value Em exp Bo Sy index Em exp Bc
The change header action will replace the
.Em value
of an existing
.Em header .
If multiple
.Em header Ns s
exist,
.Em index
may be used to replace only a particular occurence of
.Em header .
.It Sy delete header Em exp Bo Sy index Em exp Bc
The delete header action will delete
.Em header .
If multiple
.Em header Ns s
exist,
.Em index
may be used to delete only a particular occurence of
.Em header .
.It Sy change from Em exp Bo Sy esmtp Em exp Bc
The change from action will replace the envelope sender address.
If
.Em esmtp
is not null, it will be interpreted as a string containing additional
ESMTP arguments.
.It Sy add rcpt Em exp Bo Sy esmtp Em exp Bc
The add rcpt action will add an envelope recipient.
If
.Em esmtp
is not null, it will be interpreted as a string containing additional
ESMTP arguments.
.It Sy delete rcpt Em exp
The delete rcpt action will remove an envelope recipient.
The recipient address must be surrounded by angle brackets.
.It Sy change body Em exp
The change body action will replace the message body.
.El
.Pp
The actions
.Em greylist ,
.Em tempfail
and
.Em reject
may be complemented by a custom SMTP reply:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ao action Ac Sy reply Em exp Bo Sy xcode Em exp Bc Sy message Em exp
The MTA will use
.Em reply
as the SMTP reply code,
.Em xcode
as the extended SMTP reply code and
.Em message
as the SMTP reply message:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# reject known spammer
#
reject reply 550 xcode "5.7.1" message "No thanks, bye!"
.Ed
.El
.Pp
The effect of
.Em accept ,
.Em greylist ,
.Em tempfail ,
.Em reject
and
.Em discard ,
the timing of a reply and the visibility of its message depend all on
the way a particular MTA implementation handles SMTP transactions.
In other words,
.Xr mopherd 8
just passes its verdict
.Pq and a reply
but has no influence on whatever the MTA will do next.
.Sh DEFINITIONS
A definition is a placeholder for any
.Em expression :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.No # simplify your Nm No with definitions
#
.No define foo Em some complicated arithmetic expression
.No define bar Em another complicated arithmetic expression

connect log "foo = " + foo
envrcpt log "bar = " + bar
data    log "foo + bar = " + (foo + bar)
.Ed
.Pp
The evaluation of definitions is not limited in any way.
Definitions may contain symbols, functions, operators or anything
else that also makes up expressions as defined in the beginning of this
document.
.Sh LISTS
A list is a searchable entity containing zero or more objects of any
type.
In
.Nm ,
a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in parentheses
constitutes a list:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# list containing strings, floats and addresses
#
("foo", "1", "", 100 + 1.1, ::1, 127.0.0.1)
.Ed
.Pp
Lists may be assigned to variables and searched with the
.Ql in
operator:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# assign list to $list
#
set $list = ("foo", "1", "", 100 + 1.1, ::1, 127.0.0.1)

# search $list for items
#
"foo" in $list	# true
100   in $list	# false
101.1 in $list	# true
::1   in $list	# true
.Ed
.Pp
While there may be few use cases for custom lists,
.Xr mopherd 8
often uses lists for certain multi-valued symbols.
.Sh SYMBOLS
The following list describes symbols known to
.Xr mopherd 8 .
Type and stage availability are enclosed in parentheses.
A symbol is either always available
.Pq Em any ,
exclusively bound to a milter stage
.Pq Em name
or bound to a milter stage and all stages following that stage
.Pq Em name* .
.Pp
.Em Note :
Evaluating certain symbols will trigger queries or other costly
operations.
In such cases,
.Xr mopherd 8
will save the result after the first evaluation and serve all subsequent
lookups from its cache.

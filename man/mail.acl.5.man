.SH INTRODUCTION
The mopher daemon
.BR mopherd (1)
uses 2 configuration files
.BR mopherd.conf (5)
and
.BR mail.acl (5).
The former controls the behaviour of the daemon itself while the latter
controls how incoming mail is filtered. By default
.B mopherd
looks for both configuration files in
.I /etc/mopher
\&. Alternative locations may be specified using the
.B mopherd
command line argument -c for
.B mopherd.conf
or the configuration directive acl_path for
.B mail.acl
\&. For more information see the respective man pages.
.SH DESCRIPTION

should filter incoming email. A statement is either a rule or a definition.

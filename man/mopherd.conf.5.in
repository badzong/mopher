.Sh NAME
.Nm mopherd.conf
.Nd the mopher daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains the default configuration used by
.Xr mopherd 8
and
.Xr mopherctl 8
to set various parameters for mopher's core functionality and its
modules.
The list of all rules enforced by mopher can be found in
.Xr mopherd.acl 5 .
.Pp
Comment lines in
.Nm
start with the
.Ql #
character, empty lines are treated as comments.
Configuration directives are key-value pairs and can span multiple
lines.
Both key and value allow for some structure in that a key may contain
indices and a value can be a table containing other (comma-separated)
key-value pairs:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
key_a		 = "string"
key_b		 = -1.0

key_c[id_x]	 = 1000
key_c[id_y]	 = 127.0.0.1

key_d = {
	key_e	 = "/path/to/file",
	key_f	 = 200K,
	key_g	 = 12h,
	key_h	 = ::1
}
.Ed
.Pp
Each integer may have one of the following optional suffixes:
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset indent -compact
.It s[econd]
multiply by 1
.It m[inute]
multiply by 60
.It h[our]
multiply by 3600
.It d[ay]
multiply by 86400
.It K[ibi]
multiply by 1024
.It M[ebi]
multiply by 1048576
.It G[ibi]
multiply by 1073741824

.Sh GENERAL CONFIGURATION
The following directives control the general behaviour of mopher
(default values are enclosed in parentheses):
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy acl_log_level Pq 3
Syslog severity level (0-7) for messages logged by the
.Em log
keyword in
.Xr mopherd.acl 5 .
.It Sy acl_path Pq Qq @CONFIG_PATH@/mopherd.acl
Path to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5 .
.\" .It Sy cleanup_interval Pq 10m
.\" FIXME: rephrase
.\" Most mopher tables need regular clean up. Depending on the used
.\" database backend this may require a full table lock and block all
.\" email delivery until the table is clean. Do not bother to change
.\" this setting unless your server handels hundreds of connections
.\" per second.
.\" .It Sy client_retry_interval Pq 10s
.\" FIXME: experimental
.It Sy control_socket Pq Qq inet:44554@127.0.0.1
Socket used by
.Xr mopherctl 8
to control a running
.Xr mopherd 8
instance.
Supported socket types are tcp (inet:port@address) and unix domain
sockets (unix:/path/to/socket).
.It Sy control_socket_permissions Pq 0660
File system permissions of
.Em control_socket .
Only applies to unix domain sockets.
.It Sy foreground Pq 0
Run in foreground, don't detach from the controlling terminal.
.It Sy greylist_deadline Pq 1d
Default maximal lifetime of a greylist item.
Older items will be removed from the greylist.
All
.Em greylist
rules in
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
without a
.Em deadline
parameter will use this value.
.It Sy greylist_visa Pq 30d
Default maximal lifetime of a greylist visa item.
Older visa items will be removed from the greylist.
Greylist items are upgraded to visa items when
.Em delay
expires or the number of
.Em attempts
is met.
Subsequent successful mail deliveries will renew any existing visa item
(i.e. reset its remaining lifetime).
.It Sy hostname Pq Xr gethostname 3
Default hostname used in self-references.
.It Sy log_level Pq 4
Syslog severity level (0-7) for messages logged by
.Xr mopherd 8 .
.It Sy milter_socket Pq inet:44555@127.0.0.1
Socket used by MTAs to communicate with a running
.Xr mopherd 8
instance.
Supported socket types are tcp (inet:port@address) and unix domain
sockets (unix:/path/to/socket).
.It Sy milter_socket_permissions Pq 0660
File system permissions of
.Em milter_socket .
Only applies to unix domain sockets.
.It Sy milter_socket_timeout Pq 7210s
Default timeout for any communication between mopher and MTAs.
.\" .It Sy milter_wait Pq 1s
.\" FIXME: rephrase
.\" Number of seconds mopherd waits for all milter threads to close upon exit.
.It Sy module_path Pq Qq @MODULE_PATH@
Path to loadable mopher modules.
.Xr mopherd 8
will load all available modules in
.Em module_path
during startup
.Pq see Sx MODULE CONFIGURATION .
.It Sy mopherd_user Pq Qq mopher
User ID of
.Xr mopherd 8
set during startup.
All files and sockets will be created as
.Em mopher_user .
.It Sy mopherd_group Pq Qq mopher
Group ID of
.Xr mopherd 8
set during startup.
All files and sockets will be created as
.Em mopher_group .
.It Sy tarpit_progress_interval Pq 10s
Interval between two progress notifications issued during tarpitting.
When
.Xr mopherd 8
is tarpitting a host, it needs to issue periodic notifications to the
MTA in order to reset its timeouts.
.It Sy workdir_path Pq Qq /
Working directory of
.Xr mopherd 8
set during startup.
.El
.Sh TABLE CONFIGURATION
Mopher keeps its lists and state in generic tables.
The following two tables are part of mopher's core functionality:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy state
Contains some
.Xr mopherd 8
state data.
Currently, it consists of a strictly increasing integer, incremented by
.Xr mopherd 8
on each new connection and used as a distinct connection identifier in
logs.
.It Sy greylist
Contains greylist and visa triplets (origin, sender and recipient
combinations) and various metadata about them.
.El
.Pp
Defining a generic table also requires specifying its backend driver.
Backend drivers will translate all requests to generic tables into
requests as they are understood by that particular backend or library.
.Pp
The two most common types of backend drivers require one of the
following two configuration directives when, for example, configuring the
.Em greylist
table:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# illustrative raw_db backend,
# implementing a whole RDBMS
table[greylist] = {
	driver		= "raw_db",
	path		= "/path/to/greylist.db"
}

# illustrative net_db backend,
# implementing socket access methods to a RDBMS
table[greylist] = {
	driver		= "net_db",
	host		= 127.0.0.1,
	database	= "mopher",
	table		= "greylist",
	user		= "mopher",
	pass		= "secret"
}
.Ed
.Pp
Currently available backend drivers are:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy bdb Pq Berkeley DB
Embedded database for key/value data.
Uses the legacy format/API (1.85) that in most distributions is either
part of the standard C library or offered separately by one of the more
recent db software-packages.
.It Sy memdb Pq Memory DB
A simple hash table stored in main memory.
Not persistent.
If no backend driver was configured for a table, that table will use the
.Em memdb
driver and therefore lose all its content as soon as
.Xr mopherd 8
shuts down.
.It Sy mysql Pq MySQL
MySQL database management system.
.It Sy pgsql Pq PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL database management system.
.It Sy sqlite3 Pq SQLite3
SQLite version 3 database management system.
.El
.Pp
.Em Note :
All backend drivers available in the mopher source distribution are
usually compiled as loadable mopher modules.
.Sh MODULE CONFIGURATION
Loadable mopher modules may extend mopher in mainly two ways:
A Module may provide additional backend drivers for tables or additional
symbols and functions that are made available to
.Xr mopherd 8
during its evaluation of
.Xr mopherd.acl 5 .
.Pp
.Xr mopherd 8
will load any module m in
.Em module_path
if
.Em modules[m]
is either unset or set to 1 and it will skip m if
.Em modules[m]
is set to 0.
.Pp
The following list only describes configuration directives for modules
that require some configuration.
See
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
for additional information on usage and behaviour.
.Ss ClamAV Resolver
.Em clamav
submits messages to clamd and maps the evaluation results to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
symbols.
.Pp
The following directives control the general behaviour of
.Em clamav :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy clamav_socket Pq Qq unix:/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
Socket used by
.Xr mopherd 8
to check incoming messages for malware.
.El
.Ss Relay and Penpal Counter
.Em counter
counts the amount of successfully delivered messages by an origin
.Pq address or domain
or penpal
.Pq origin, sender and recipient combination .
Both counters are stored in tables and therefore require the selection
of a backend driver:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
table[counter_relay] = {
	driver		= "bdb",
	path		= "/path/to/relay.db"
}

table[counter_penpal] = {
	driver		= "bdb",
	path		= "/path/to/penpal.db"
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following directives control the general behaviour of
.Em counter :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy counter_expire_low Pq 7d
Default maximal lifetime of a counter item with a value less than
.Em counter_threshold .
.It Sy counter_expire_high Pq 60d
Default maximal lifetime of a counter item with a value greater than
.Em counter_threshold .
.It Sy counter_threshold Pq 3
See
.Em counter_expire_low
and
.Em counter_expire_high .
.El
.Ss DNSBL Resolver
.Em dnsbl
maps DNSBL query results to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
symbols.
Each black- or whitelist needs to be defined through the indexed keyword
.Em dnsbl
before it can be used in
.Xr mopherd.acl 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnsbl[list_foo] = blacklist.foo.org
dnsbl[list_bar] = whitelist.bar.net
.Ed
.Pp
where the name of the index is the name of the symbol exported to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5 .
.Ss GeoIP Location Resolver
.Em geoip
queries Maxmind's GeoLite databases and maps the resulting country names
and codes to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
symbols.
.Pp
The following directives control the general behaviour of
.Em geoip :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy geoip_database Pq Qq /var/local/lib/geoip/GeoIP.dat
Path to GeoLite IPv4 database file.
.It Sy geoipv6_database Pq Qq /var/local/lib/geoip/GeoIPv6.dat
Path to GeoLite IPv6 database file.
.El
.\".Pp
.\".Em geoip
.\"is disabled by default.
.\" FIXME: related section is missing
.Ss P0f Fingerprint Resolver
.Em p0f
submits addresses to a p0f version 3 server process and maps the
evaluation results to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
symbols.
.Pp
The following directives control the general behaviour of
.Em p0f :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy p0f_socket Pq Qq unix:/var/run/p0f/p0f.sock
Socket used by
.Xr mopherd 8
to request OS fingerprints.
.El
.Ss SpamAssassin Resolver
.Em spamd
submits messages to SpamAssassin and maps the evaluation results to
.Xr mopherd.acl 5
symbols.
.Pp
The following directives control the general behaviour of
.Em spamd
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy spamd_socket Pq Qq inet:783@127.0.0.1
Socket used by
.Xr mopherd 8
to check incoming messages for their score and matching tests.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Third party distributors of binary packages may split a full mopher
build into several complementary packages in order to make some
dependencies optional.
In such cases, it is possible that some modules are not available on
your system even though they are documented here.
